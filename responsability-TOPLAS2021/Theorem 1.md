[[Responsability]]
If $\tau_R$ is said to be responsible for a behavior $\mathcal B$ in a valid trace $\sigma_H \tau_R \sigma_F$, then $\sigma_H \tau_R$ guarantees the occurrence of the behavior $\mathcal B$, and there must exist another valid prefix trace $\sigma_H \tau_R'$ such that the behavior $\mathcal B$ is guaranteed.
