The property learning process is defined in the next 3 steps :
1. *Inquiry function* : is defined to map every trace $\sigma \in S^{* \infty}$ to the strongest maximal trace property in $\mathcal L ^{Max}$ that $\sigma$ can guarantee. [[Corollary 3]] [[LEMMA 2]]  [[Corollary 4]]
2. *Cognizance function* : it is necessary to take the observer's cognizance into account. [[Corollary 5]]
3. *Observation function* : for the observer with cognizance function $\mathbb C$, given a single trace $\sigma$, the observer cannot distinguish $\sigma$ with other traces in $\mathbb C(\sigma)$. [[Corollary 6]] [[Corollary 7]] [[LEMMA 3]].
