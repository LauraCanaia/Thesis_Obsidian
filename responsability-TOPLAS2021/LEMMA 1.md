For any maximal trace property $X \in \wp([\![P]\!]^{Max})$, If a prefix trace $\sigma$ belongs to the prediction trace property $\alpha_{Pred}([\![P]\!]^{Max})X$, then $\sigma$ guarantees the satisfaction of property X (i.e. every valid maximal trace that is greater than or equal to $\sigma$ is guaranteed to have the property X).

This lemma says more or less that we have a [[Def. 2.12]] Galois Connection.
