*Galois connection*
Given two posets $(C, \leq)$ and $(A, \sqsubseteq)$, the pair $(\alpha : \ C \rightarrow A, \gamma : \ A \rightarrow C)$ is a Galois connection if :
$\forall a \in A, c \in C, \ c \leq \gamma(a) \iff \alpha(c) \sqsubseteq a$ 
which is denoted as ![[Pasted image 20231122183628.png]].
$\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are said to be adjoint functions, where the abstraction $\alpha$ is the upper adjoint and the concretization $\gamma$ is the lower adjoint.
The fundamental property of Galois connection ([[Def. 2.5]]) provides, in a very compact form, a strong connection between the concrete and the abstract world.
