[[survey temporal logic.pdf]]
Are extensions of [[Propositional Temporal Logic (PTL)]], and these kind of logics also allow arbitrary data structures and quantifiers.
There kind of logics suffer from high computational complexity because there logics are really expressive.
One important logic is *monodic* fragment of first-order temporal logic defined in [77], which showed that it is an expressive logic with a feasible computational behavior. 
In this kind of logic, one free variable is allowed at most.

A first-order temporal logic is represented by QTL.
