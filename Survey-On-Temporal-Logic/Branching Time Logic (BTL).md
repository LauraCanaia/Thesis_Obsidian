The underlying semantics of the structure is time branching (branching time structures explained in [[Temporal structure]]).
Every time instant can be followed by several immediate successors time instants.
In branching time logics there are 2 kinds of formulas : *state* formulas and *path* formulas.
These logics have been extensively used to verify finite state systems.
