Interval temporal logics are expressive, since these logics can express a relationship between 2 events, which are represented by intervals.
The interval logic has a higher level of abstraction than a point based temporal logic. This makes interval logic formulas much simpler and more comprehensive than point-based logic formulas.
*Interval structures can be considered in 2 ways* :
1. Intervals are 'primitive' objects  : [[Period structure]];
2. Intervals are composed from points : [[Set of points]].
