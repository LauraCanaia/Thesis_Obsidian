It is very easy to define properties *linearity, density, discreteness, unboundedness*.
The time flow is assumed as "a strict partial ordering of time points".
An interval structure is defined as $\langle \mathcal T, \mathcal I(\mathcal T) \rangle$, where $\mathcal T = \langle T, < \rangle$ is a strict partial ordering and $\mathcal I(\mathcal T)$ is a set of intervals.
