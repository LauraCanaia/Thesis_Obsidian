*Operator composition*
Assume that $f, \ f' \ : \ C \rightarrow C$ are concrete operators, and $g, \ g' \ : \ A \rightarrow A$ are abstract operators : 
1. if $g$ and $g'$ are sound abstractions of respectively $f$ and $f'$, and $f$ is monotonic, then $g \circ g'$ is a sound abstraction of $f \circ f'$ ;
2. if $g$ and $g'$ are exact abstractions of respectively $f$ and $f'$, then $g \circ g'$ is an exact abstraction of $f \circ f'$ .
