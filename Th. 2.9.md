if $f$ is a monotonic operator in a complete concrete lattice and $g$ is a sound abstraction of $f$, then the following iteration :
$x^0 \overset{\operatorname{def}}{=} \bot$
$x^{i+1} \overset{\operatorname{def}}{=} x^i \bigtriangledown g(x^i)$  
converges in finite time, and its limit x is a sound abstraction of the least fixpoint $lfp \ f$ : $lfp \ f \le \gamma()x$ .
